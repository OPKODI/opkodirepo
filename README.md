# OP Kodi Repo
The Official OP KODI Repository.

## Do you allow streaming addons?
Short answer: Yes. You **may not** include copyrighted content in the files of the addon. The OP Kodi team does not support piracy in any manner. Streaming addons can be used for legitimate content, and it is up to the user to use their discretion. **OP Kodi takes no responsibility for any addons hosted. All DMCA or equivelant complaints must go to the author of said addons.**

## For Developers
To add your addon, contact me at opkodi(at)protonmail.com. Please include all necessary fles, such as art. If you have multiple addons for things such as metadata, that will be added as well. We will generate XML files for addons, and descriptions must be sent to the email above.
